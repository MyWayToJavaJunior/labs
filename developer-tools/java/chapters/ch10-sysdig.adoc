= Monitoring Docker Container Using Sysdig

Containers are seeing rapid adoption due to the simplicity, consistency and portability by which developers can get their code from a laptop to production. They often provide the building blocks for creating microservices. This layer of abstraction is great for development, but not so great for operations. Containers can also be seen as blackboxes: visibility and monitoring are technologically harder to implement for containerized applications than legacy virtual or physical environments. Deploying a monitoring agent in each container is both expensive in resources, and creates dependencies that could limit the value of containers increasing complexity.

Sysdig has the ability to monitor inside your containers without instrumenting each one individualy with a monitoring agent or requiring you to instrument your code. In order to offer high-level-service-wide visibility, Sysdig takes 2 parallel approaches:

- *Kernel level instrumentation*: All system calls are captured through a simple Linux kernel module providing full visibility and autodiscovery of everything being executed in the host no matter if running inside containers

- *Docker orchestration infrastructure metadata*: Talking to the Docker container orchestration platform, Sysdig understands all the components that build your infrastructure and automatically can aggregate metrics and events into service level information. This allows you to understand the operability of your infrastructure from the top level down to the individuals of each process.

Then we can answer questions like: "What's the response time of my Couchbase service that's currently distributed over six servers in 2 availability zones? What are the slowest queries?"

Sysdig is available in two flavors:

- https://www.sysdig.org/[Sysdig opensource] is a freely available tool to gain visibility inside containers running on a single host being able to filter out from system calls up to files read or written, or network requests. 

- https://support.sysdigcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/204865765-Overview[Sysdig Cloud] is best for monitoring across multiple hosts, looking at service and applications availability and performance, troubleshooting and alerting. Sysdig Cloud comes at a cost per host but you can register for a free trial from https://sysdig.com/docker-monitoring/[Sysdig Docker monitoring].

This section of the workshop will explain how to use Sysdig Cloud to monitor Docker containers.

== Setup AWS EC2 Instance

Sysdig will only work on a Linux flavor. For example, this will not work on Docker for Mac or Windows. This chapter uses an Ubuntu 14.04 instance on Amazon EC2.

Setup an Ubuntu instance on AWS EC2:

. Start Ubuntu 14.04 LTS instance with m3.medium instance type. Make sure to add port 8091 to inbound security rules. This allows Couchbase Web Console to be accessible afterwards.
. Login: ssh -i ~/.ssh/arun-cb-west1.pem ubuntu@<public-ip>
. Update the install: `sudo apt-get update`
. Install Docker: `curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh`. More detailed instructions are available at https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/[Get Docker for Ubuntu].
. Enable non-root access: `sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu`
. Logout and log back in to enabe non-root access
. Install Docker Compose:
+
```
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.11.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

== Compose file

Use the following `docker-compose.yml` for our application:

```
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: arungupta/couchbase-javaee:travel
    environment:
      - COUCHBASE_URI=db
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
      - 9990:9990
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: arungupta/couchbase:travel
    ports:
      - 8091:8091
      - 8092:8092
      - 8093:8093
      - 11210:11210
  sysdig-agent:
    container_name: sysdig-agent
    privileged: true
    image: sysdig/agent
    restart: always
    network_mode: "host"
    pid: "host"
    environment:
      ACCESS_KEY: YOUR-ACCESS-KEY
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/host/var/run/docker.sock
      - /dev:/host/dev
      - /proc:/host/proc:ro
      - /boot:/host/boot:ro
      - /lib/modules:/host/lib/modules:ro
      - /usr:/host/usr:ro
  client:
    image: ltagliamonte/recurling
    environment:
      - URL=http://web:8080/airlines/resources/airline/{,10,10123,10642,10748,10765,112,1191,9999,8888,7777,6666}
```

This Compose definition includes four services. `db` and `web` service are explained at https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/developer-tools/java/chapters/ch05-compose.adoc#configuration-file. `sysdig-agent` and `client` will be explained subsequently.

== Setup Sysdig Cloud

Sign up for a trial account of Sysdig Cloud at http://sysdig.com. Check your email and activate the account.

Configure Sysdig Cloud agent at http://app.sysdigcloud.com. Click on `Next>`. Select `Docker` installation method:

.Sysdig Docker Installation
image::sysdig-docker-installation.png[]

The next window shows a command to start Sysdig Cloud container on the host. It looks something like:

```
docker run -d --name sysdig-agent --privileged --net host --pid host -e ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY -e TAGS=example_tag:example_value -v /var/run/docker.sock:/host/var/run/docker.sock -v /dev:/host/dev -v /proc:/host/proc:ro -v /boot:/host/boot:ro -v /lib/modules:/host/lib/modules:ro -v /usr:/host/usr:ro sysdig/agent
```

This command is specified as `sysdig-agent` service in the Compose file definition shown above. This will start Sysdig Cloud agent that will capture system calls and forward metrics to Sysdig Cloud.

In the Compose file definition, make sure to replace `YOUR-ACCESS-KEY` with the access key value shown in the command.

Finally we can start the agent container:

```
docker-compose up -d sysdig-agent
```

This will show the output:

```

== Start Application

Start the database:

```
docker-compose up -d db
```

Start the application:

```
docker-compose up -d web
```

Check the status of running containers using `docker-compse ps`. This shows the output as:

```

```

== Load Generation With a Fake Client

Since we want to monitor and see how our application performs under some load, we will use Docker again to spawn a fake client that will generate some load. Very complex and customizable load generation methods exist, but in this case we want to keep things as simple as possible. So we will just use a container that performs requests with `curl` inside a loop over an array of URLs we configure. In the previous `docker-compose.yml` we also added a new client service for this task. To bring it up, we will run like before:

```
docker-compose up -d client
```

== Full Stack Monitoring

A better visibility into the performance limitations of our Java applications requires to make use of a full stack monitoring tool. This basically means being able to gain visibility from the infrastructure (either physical, virtual or cloud) through the different services we run up to the requests the users make against our application. Let's visit these layers individually and understand what are the most important resources, availability and operation metrics we should monitor.

One of the most visually appealing features of Sysdig Cloud are the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ZJJLPuQwo[topology maps]. They are able to automatically draw the infrastructure, understanding the services, containers and the processes runing inside each container. In our case, this is defined using `docker-compose.yml`.

.Sysdig Topology Maps
image::sysdig-topology.png[]

Topology maps are available in the `Explore` tab. Click on `Show` to select the scope that needs to be displayed. Apply the grouping for Docker Compose and select the top level project.

Then on `Views`, search for "`topology`", select any of the prebuilt views `CPU Usage`, `Network Traffic` or `Response Times`. These visualization can be pinned into an existing or new dashboards. Then from the dashboard itself you can modify the scope of the topology (showing only one service for example) or the metrics displayed in the entity boxes or the links between the boxes.

=== Infrastructure Monitoring

When monitoring at the infrastructure layer we must look first at hosts or nodes availability and resources usage:

- Is the host or node up and reachable or down?
- What is the load and CPU usage?
- What is the memory and swap usage?
- What is the disk activity (IOPS) and file system usage?
- What is the network traffic and latency?
- If using any orchestration platform like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, what's the overall health of the cluster?

A good start point is the `Overview by Container` view applied to our Docker Compose project in the `Explore` tab. This is located in `Hosts & Containers` view or you can search for it as well.

.View of the infrastructure resources usage
image::sysdig-infrastructure.png[]

=== Services Monitoring

Monitoring different services really depends on the internals of each one. If we look at them from the application point of view then we can measure request response time, request count, CPU and memory usage. Obviously we also need to check if the service is actually running and when doing so inside containers, if the containers are running and how many of them.

As we mentioned before, ideally we should be able to autodiscover the different services that we run automatically, including databases, application servers, web servers, load balancers, etc.

Again, Sysdig Cloud offers a pre-built view of the most relevant metrics aggregated by service through the `Overview by Service` view:

.View of the services running autodiscovered from Docker Compose
image::sysdig-services.png[]

If you want to dig deeper and look at the specifics of each service we are running in this example, keep reading.

==== JVM/WildFly Monitoring

When running any Java app, one of the first things we need to do is look at the metrics that the JVM exposes by default. These include threads, heap usage and garbage collection. If your Java application exposes JMX, you can collect them together with your JVM metrics.

To have a look at these metrics, we can either use the default `JVM` view. Alternatively, this view can be tweaked a little bit by creating a new dashboard using the wizard and selecting the `JVM` template to get something like this:

.Sysdig Cloud dashboard for JVM 
image::sysdig-jvm.png[]

==== Couchbase Monitoring

Monitoring Couchbase requires some understanding of the architecture of this NoSQL database. We will monitor some availability metrics like connections per second, database size or objects stored but to understand the performance bottlenecks we will quickly have to include operations per second, resident objects in memory vs disk, ejections, cache misses or disk read/write and writing queue.

If you are avid on reading more about Couchbase monitoring, trying to understand why metrics move around and when you should care, https://blog.couchbase.com/monitoring-couchbase-cluster[Couchbase Monitoring] blog post is a good start point.

Sysdig also offers a a template for Couchbase. You will find templates for this one and more than 60 other technologies that can be monitored with Sysdig Cloud when creating a new dashboard.

.Sysdig Cloud dashboard for Couchbase
image::sysdig-couchbase.png[]

=== Application Monitoring

To close our monitoring jar, we will close the lid with application monitoring. Usually this requires heavy code instrumentation but if we just want to look at the HTTP requests of our API endpoint, Sysdig Cloud is able to automatically decode the HTTP requests going through read and writes in the sockets file descriptors. Without any code or service instrumentation we just got application layer metrics! Here we can identify average and maximum request time, requests per second, which are the top URL endpoints or the slowest ones.

On Sysdig Cloud views can be applied to different scopes and Sysdig will try to see if relevant metrics do exist in that scope. For example we know that our Java app offers a web service. We can apply the `HTTP Overview` over the scope of our app (`web` service) like if it was a HTTP server to get a view like this:

.Sysdig Cloud HTTP view
image::sysdig-webapp.png[]

== Key Learnings

If we had to sumarize the key learnings to take from Monitoring Docker Container with Sysdig, we would like you to keep the following:

- Docker containers are like blackboxes, great for development but hard to monitor. Docker monitoring API gives you limited visibility, syscalls allow you to see everything.
- Instrument everything! Instrumenting comes at a cost, Sysdig help you making instrumenting a just one shot process: installing Sysdig Cloud agent on each of your hosts.
- Collect all the metrics! We never know when a metric will come handy, so leave the agent collect all the metric but only keep an eye on the key ones at the service level, not individually for each container.
